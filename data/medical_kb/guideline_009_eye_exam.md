# Dilated Eye Examination for Diabetic Retinopathy

## Category: Retinopathy Screening
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2024, AAO Guidelines

## Recommendation

For patients with type 2 diabetes:
- **Initial dilated eye exam** at the time of diabetes diagnosis
- **Subsequent exams** at least annually
- May extend to every 2 years if no retinopathy and good glycemic control

## Evidence Level
Grade B - Supported by natural history studies and screening effectiveness data.

## Clinical Details

### Diabetic Retinopathy Stages

1. **No apparent retinopathy**: No abnormalities
2. **Mild NPDR**: Microaneurysms only
3. **Moderate NPDR**: Microaneurysms + hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, venous beading
4. **Severe NPDR**: >= 20 hemorrhages in each quadrant, venous beading in 2+ quadrants
5. **Proliferative DR**: Neovascularization, vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage

### Screening Methods

- Comprehensive dilated eye exam by ophthalmologist or optometrist (preferred)
- Validated digital retinal photography with remote reading (acceptable)
- Photography does not replace comprehensive exam if abnormalities detected

### Risk Factors for Progression

- Duration of diabetes
- Poor glycemic control
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Pregnancy
- Nephropathy

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND no documented dilated eye exam in past 12 months, flag as **EYE EXAM OVERDUE**.

## Action Required

Refer to ophthalmology or optometry for dilated funduscopic examination. Ensure patient understands importance of regular screening even without visual symptoms.
