# A1C Testing Frequency

## Category: Diabetes Monitoring
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2024

## Recommendation

A1C testing should be performed:
- **At least twice yearly** in patients meeting treatment goals with stable glycemic control
- **Quarterly** in patients not meeting goals or with therapy changes

## Evidence Level
Grade E - Expert consensus.

## Clinical Details

- A1C provides assessment of glycemic control over preceding 2-3 months
- Point-of-care A1C testing allows for timely treatment adjustments
- A1C may be unreliable in conditions affecting red blood cell turnover:
  - Hemoglobinopathies
  - Anemia
  - Recent blood transfusion
  - End-stage renal disease
  - Pregnancy
- In these cases, use fructosamine or glycated albumin

## Testing Schedule

| Glycemic Control | Therapy Changes | Testing Frequency |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| At goal         | None            | Every 6 months    |
| At goal         | Recent          | Every 3 months    |
| Not at goal     | Any             | Every 3 months    |

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND last A1C test > 6 months ago, flag as **A1C TESTING OVERDUE**.

## Action Required

Order A1C test. Review glycemic trends and adjust therapy as needed.
