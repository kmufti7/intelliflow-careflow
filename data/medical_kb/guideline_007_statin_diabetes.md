# Statin Therapy for Diabetic Patients

## Category: Cardiovascular Protection
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care 2024, ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines

## Recommendation

For patients with diabetes aged 40-75 years:
- **Without ASCVD**: Moderate-intensity statin therapy
- **With ASCVD or high risk**: High-intensity statin therapy
- **Age < 40 or > 75**: Individualize based on risk factors

## Evidence Level
Grade A - Strong evidence from multiple large RCTs.

## Clinical Details

### Statin Intensity Categories

**High-intensity** (lowers LDL >= 50%):
- Atorvastatin 40-80 mg
- Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg

**Moderate-intensity** (lowers LDL 30-49%):
- Atorvastatin 10-20 mg
- Rosuvastatin 5-10 mg
- Simvastatin 20-40 mg
- Pravastatin 40-80 mg

### Additional Risk Factors Favoring High-Intensity
- LDL >= 100 mg/dL
- Hypertension
- Smoking
- Chronic kidney disease
- Albuminuria
- Family history of premature ASCVD

## Monitoring

- Lipid panel before initiation and 4-12 weeks after starting/changing therapy
- Monitor for muscle symptoms
- No routine CK or liver function tests needed unless symptomatic

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND age 40-75 AND NOT on statin therapy, flag as **STATIN NOT PRESCRIBED**.

## Action Required

Initiate moderate-intensity statin. Consider high-intensity if additional CV risk factors present.
