# A1C Target for Diabetic Patients

## Category: Diabetes Management
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2024

## Recommendation

For most adults with type 2 diabetes, the target A1C should be **less than 7.0%** (53 mmol/mol).

## Evidence Level
Grade A - Based on well-designed RCTs and meta-analyses.

## Clinical Details

- A1C reflects average blood glucose over the preceding 2-3 months
- Achieving A1C < 7.0% has been shown to reduce microvascular complications
- More stringent goals (< 6.5%) may be appropriate for:
  - Patients with short duration of diabetes
  - Long life expectancy
  - No significant cardiovascular disease
- Less stringent goals (< 8.0%) may be appropriate for:
  - History of severe hypoglycemia
  - Limited life expectancy
  - Advanced complications
  - Extensive comorbidities

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND A1C >= 7.0%, flag as **A1C NOT AT GOAL**.

## Action Required

Consider intensification of glycemic therapy if A1C remains above goal for 3+ months.
