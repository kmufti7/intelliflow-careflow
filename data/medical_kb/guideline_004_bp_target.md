# Blood Pressure Target for Diabetic Patients

## Category: Cardiovascular Protection
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes with Hypertension
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care 2024, ACC/AHA Guidelines

## Recommendation

For patients with diabetes and hypertension, the target blood pressure should be **< 130/80 mmHg** if it can be achieved safely.

## Evidence Level
Grade B - Moderate evidence with some variation based on patient factors.

## Clinical Details

- Blood pressure should be measured at every routine clinical visit
- Diagnosis of hypertension requires:
  - Two or more elevated readings on two or more occasions
  - OR single reading >= 180/110 mmHg with evidence of target organ damage
- Home blood pressure monitoring is encouraged
- White coat hypertension should be excluded

## Treatment Approach

1. Lifestyle modifications (all patients):
   - Dietary sodium reduction (< 2,300 mg/day)
   - DASH diet pattern
   - Weight loss if overweight
   - Physical activity (150 min/week moderate intensity)
   - Moderation of alcohol intake

2. Pharmacologic therapy:
   - ACE inhibitor or ARB first-line for diabetic patients
   - Often requires 2-3 medications to achieve target
   - Add thiazide-like diuretic or calcium channel blocker as needed

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND BP >= 140/90, flag as **BLOOD PRESSURE NOT CONTROLLED**.

## Action Required

Intensify antihypertensive therapy and reinforce lifestyle modifications. Consider home BP monitoring.
