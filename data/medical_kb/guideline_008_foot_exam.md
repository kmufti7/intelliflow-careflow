# Annual Comprehensive Foot Examination

## Category: Neuropathy Screening
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2024

## Recommendation

All patients with diabetes should have a **comprehensive foot examination at least annually** to identify risk factors for ulcers and amputations.

## Evidence Level
Grade B - Supported by observational studies and clinical experience.

## Clinical Details

### Components of Comprehensive Foot Exam

1. **Inspection**
   - Skin integrity (calluses, ulcers, blisters)
   - Deformities (hammertoes, bunions, Charcot foot)
   - Nail abnormalities
   - Evidence of prior amputation

2. **Assessment of Peripheral Neuropathy**
   - 10-g monofilament testing (at least 4 sites per foot)
   - One of: vibration (128-Hz tuning fork), pinprick, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold

3. **Vascular Assessment**
   - Pedal pulses (dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial)
   - ABI if pulses diminished or symptoms present

### Risk Categories

| Category | Findings | Follow-up |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Low risk | Normal sensation, no deformity | Annual |
| Moderate risk | Loss of protective sensation OR deformity | Every 3-6 months |
| High risk | Loss of sensation + deformity OR prior ulcer/amputation | Every 1-3 months |

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND no documented foot exam in past 12 months, flag as **FOOT EXAM OVERDUE**.

## Action Required

Perform comprehensive foot examination. Provide patient education on daily foot self-inspection and appropriate footwear.
