# ACE Inhibitor or ARB for Diabetic Patients with Hypertension

## Category: Cardiovascular Protection
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes with Hypertension
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care 2024, ACC/AHA Hypertension Guidelines

## Recommendation

Patients with diabetes AND hypertension should be treated with an **ACE inhibitor or ARB** as first-line therapy.

## Evidence Level
Grade A - Strong evidence from multiple RCTs.

## Clinical Details

- ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril) and ARBs (e.g., losartan, valsartan) provide:
  - Blood pressure reduction
  - Renal protection (reduce albuminuria progression)
  - Cardiovascular risk reduction
- Do NOT combine ACE inhibitor with ARB (increased risk of hyperkalemia and renal impairment)
- Monitor potassium and creatinine within 1-2 weeks of initiation

## Contraindications

- Pregnancy
- History of angioedema with ACE inhibitors
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis
- Serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND hypertension AND is NOT on ACE inhibitor or ARB, flag as **ACE/ARB NOT PRESCRIBED**.

## Action Required

Initiate ACE inhibitor (preferred) or ARB therapy unless contraindicated. Common starting doses:
- Lisinopril 5-10 mg daily
- Losartan 25-50 mg daily
