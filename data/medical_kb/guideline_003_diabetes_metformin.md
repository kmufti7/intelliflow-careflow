## Recommendation

**Metformin** should be initiated as first-line pharmacologic therapy for type 2 diabetes, along with lifestyle modifications, unless contraindicated.

## Evidence Level
Grade A - Extensive evidence supporting efficacy and safety.

## Clinical Details

- Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic glucose production
- Does not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy
- May promote modest weight loss or weight neutrality
- Cardiovascular benefit demonstrated in UKPDS
- Start at 500 mg once or twice daily with meals
- Titrate to maximum effective dose (usually 2000 mg/day)

## Contraindications

- eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m² (absolute contraindication)
- eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73m² (use with caution, do not initiate)
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis
- Severe hepatic impairment

## Side Effects

- GI symptoms (nausea, diarrhea) - common initially
- Vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term use
- Lactic acidosis (rare)

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND is NOT on metformin AND eGFR >= 45, flag as **METFORMIN NOT PRESCRIBED**.
