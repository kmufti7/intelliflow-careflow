# Kidney Function Monitoring in Diabetes

## Category: Nephropathy Screening
## Condition: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
## Source: ADA Standards of Medical Care 2024, KDIGO Guidelines

## Recommendation

For patients with diabetes:
- Assess **urinary albumin** (UACR) and **eGFR** at least **annually**
- Begin screening at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
- Begin screening 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes

## Evidence Level
Grade B - Well-supported by prospective studies.

## Clinical Details

### Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR)
- Normal: < 30 mg/g
- Moderately increased (microalbuminuria): 30-299 mg/g
- Severely increased (macroalbuminuria): >= 300 mg/g
- Requires 2 of 3 abnormal specimens over 3-6 months to confirm

### eGFR Categories
- G1: >= 90 (normal or high)
- G2: 60-89 (mildly decreased)
- G3a: 45-59 (mildly to moderately decreased)
- G3b: 30-44 (moderately to severely decreased)
- G4: 15-29 (severely decreased)
- G5: < 15 (kidney failure)

## Interventions by Stage

- UACR >= 30: Initiate or optimize ACE inhibitor/ARB
- eGFR < 60: Adjust medication dosing, avoid nephrotoxins
- eGFR < 30: Refer to nephrology

## Care Gap Trigger

If patient has diabetes AND (no UACR in past year OR no eGFR in past year), flag as **KIDNEY SCREENING OVERDUE**.

## Action Required

Order comprehensive metabolic panel (includes creatinine/eGFR) and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.
